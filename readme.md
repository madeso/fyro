Fyrö or fyro is a simple 2d rendering opengl playground/engine.

Quad or quadliteral translated to swedish is fyrhörning. There isn't any accepted short form fyrhörning so I picked the first four letters that made sense and sounded good.

Fyrö also means lightouse island but that's not related but it could be the base of a logo or something :)
