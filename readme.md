Fyrö or fyro is a simple 2d rendering opengl playground/engine.

Quad or quadliteral translated to swedish is fyrhörning. There isn't any accepted short form fyrhörning so I picked the first four letters that made sense and sounded good.

Procounce it as either fyro: "FIR (as in fire) -Oh" or as fyrö: "Phyr(phy as in physical) -Uh (as in Uhm)"

Fyrö also means lightouse island but that's not related but it could be the base of a logo or something :)

* extend api to something similar to flixel
* add hot reload
* port to webgl, android, raspberry pi
* port gamejam games for more samples
